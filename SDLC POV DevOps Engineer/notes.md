# Software Development Life Cycle
- SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. 
- SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.
- The SDLC involves six phases :
   - Requirements and Planning
   - Defining
   - Software design such as architectural design
   - Building(Software development)
   - Testing
   - Deployment

# Different Stages of SDLC :->

## Identify the Current Problems
“What are the current problems?” This stage of the SDLC means getting input from all stakeholders, including customers, salespeople, industry experts, and programmers. Learn the strengths and weaknesses of the current system with improvement as the goal.

## Plan 
“What do we want?” In this stage of the SDLC, the team determines the cost and resources required for implementing the analyzed requirements. It also details the risks involved and provides sub-plans for softening those risks.

In other words, the team should determine the feasibility of the project and how they can implement the project successfully with the lowest risk in mind.

## Defining 
Software Requirement Specification document is drafted.

## Designing
“How will we get what we want?” This phase of the SDLC starts by turning the software specifications into a design plan called the Design Specification. All stakeholders then review this plan and offer feedback and suggestions. It’s crucial to have a plan for collecting and incorporating stakeholder input into this document. Failure at this stage will almost certainly result in cost overruns at best and the total collapse of the project at worst.

LLD and HLD are get discussed e.g, if we want to use some database whether to use MySQL or any other things like this.

## Build
“Let’s create what we want.”

At this stage, the actual development starts. It’s important that every developer sticks to the agreed blueprint. Also, make sure you have proper guidelines in place about the code style and practices.

For example, define a nomenclature for files or define a variable naming style such as camelCase. This will help your team to produce organized and consistent code that is easier to understand but also to test during the next phase.

This area mainly belongs to the developers.

## Code Test
“Did we get what we want?” In this stage, we test for defects and deficiencies. We fix those issues until the product meets the original specifications.

In short, we want to verify if the code meets the defined requirements.

This job is assigned to Quality Assurance Engineers.

## Software Deployment
“Let’s start using what we got.”

At this stage, the goal is to deploy the software to the production environment so users can start using the product. However, many organizations choose to move the product through different deployment environments such as a testing or staging environment.

This allows any stakeholders to safely play with the product before releasing it to the market. Besides, this allows any final mistakes to be caught before releasing the product.

## Extra: Software Maintenance
“Let’s get this closer to what we want.” The plan almost never turns out perfect when it meets reality. Further, as conditions in the real world change, we need to update and advance the software to match.

# DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Planning
- DevOps encourages collaboration between development and operations teams right from the planning phase to ensure that both teams are aligned with the project goals.
- Continuous feedback loops are established to incorporate insights from operations into the planning phase..

## Coding
- DevOps promotes the use of version control systems, collaborative coding practices, and automated code review tools to ensure code quality and traceability.
- Automation is introduced for repetitive tasks, reducing the chances of errors and speeding up the development process.

## Building
- Automation tools are employed for continuous integration (CI) to automatically build and integrate code changes, ensuring that the software is always in a deployable state.
- DevOps practices emphasize consistency and repeatability in the build process through the use of infrastructure as code (IaC) and build automation tools.

## Testing
- Automated testing is a crucial aspect of DevOps. Continuous testing is integrated into the development process to identify and address issues early in the SDLC.
- DevOps encourages the use of testing environments that closely resemble the production environment, ensuring more accurate testing results.

## Deployment
- Continuous Deployment (CD) is a key DevOps practice that automates the deployment process, enabling frequent and reliable releases.
- DevOps practices include release management and orchestration to coordinate and manage the deployment of applications across different environments.
- Continuous monitoring is introduced to track application performance and detect issues in real-time.

## Monitoring and Feedback
- DevOps emphasizes continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure to identify performance issues, bugs, or security vulnerabilities.
- Feedback loops are established to gather insights from production environments, informing future development and deployment decisions.

## Operations and Maintenance
- DevOps practices extend into ongoing operations, emphasizing efficient infrastructure management through automation and monitoring.
- DevOps principles help teams respond quickly to incidents, enabling efficient troubleshooting and resolution.

` DevOps is not confined to a specific phase of the SDLC but is integrated throughout the entire process. It brings together development and operations, promotes automation, and aims to deliver software more rapidly, reliably, and efficiently.`

# Most Common SDLC Models

1. **Waterfall Model :-**
This SDLC model is the oldest and most straightforward. With this methodology, we finish one phase and then start the next. Each phase has its own mini-plan and each phase “waterfalls” into the next. The biggest drawback of this model is that small details left incomplete can hold up the entire process.

2. **Agile Model :-**
The Agile SDLC model separates the product into cycles and delivers a working product very quickly. This methodology produces a succession of releases. Testing of each release feeds back info that’s incorporated into the next version. According to Robert Half, the drawback of this model is that the heavy emphasis on customer interaction can lead the project in the wrong direction in some cases.

3. **Iterative Model :-**
This SDLC model emphasizes repetition. Developers create a version very quickly and for relatively little cost, then test and improve it through rapid and successive versions. One big disadvantage here is that it can eat up resources fast if left unchecked.

4. **V-Shaped Model :-**
An extension of the waterfall model, this SDLC methodology tests at each stage of development. As with waterfall, this process can run into roadblocks.

5. **Big Bang Model :-**
This high-risk SDLC model throws most of its resources at development and works best for small projects. It lacks the thorough requirements definition stage of the other methods.

6. **Spiral Model :-**
The most flexible of the SDLC models, the spiral model is similar to the iterative model in its emphasis on repetition. The spiral model goes through the planning, design, build and test phases over and over, with gradual improvements at each pass.

`The project's specification and intended results significantly influence which model to use.`

# Which SDLC models is the best and commonly used ?
Each SDLC model offers a unique process for your team’s various project challenges. The project’s specifications and intended results significantly influence which model to use. For example, the waterfall model works best for projects where your team has no or limited access to customers to provide constant feedback. However, the Agile model’s flexibility is preferred for complex projects with constantly changing requirements.

Hence, the `Agile SDLC model` has recently become increasingly popular and in demand. This demand can be primarily linked to the agile model’s flexibility and core principles. By its core principles, we mean adaptability, customer involvement, lean development, teamwork, time, sustainability, and testing, with its two primary elements being teamwork and time (faster delivery). So rather than creating a timeline for the project, agile breaks the project into individual deliverable ‘time-boxed’ pieces called sprints. This model prioritizes flexibility, adaptability, collaboration, communication, and quality while promoting early and continuous delivery. Ultimately, all this ensures that the final product meets customer needs and can quickly respond to market demands.
